# Calculator

## Overview
This project is a simple calculator GUI application built using the Tkinter library in Python. It provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with additional functionalities like square root, percentage calculation, and memory operations. The project contributors are Abdullah Al Sady and Abdullah Al Sabit Khan.

## Functionality

### Basic Arithmetic Operations
- Users can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Buttons labeled with digits 0-9 allow users to input numbers into the expression field.
- The '/' button represents division.
- The '*' button represents multiplication.
- The '-' button represents subtraction.
- The '+' button represents addition.

### Special Functions
1. **Equal (=) Button**:
   - Pressing the '=' button evaluates the current expression and displays the result.
   - *It handles potential errors such as division by zero or syntax errors and displays 'Error' in such cases*.

2. **Clear Button**:
   - The 'Clear' button clears the input/output field, allowing users to start a new calculation.

3. **Backspace Button**:
   - The 'Backspace' button removes the last character from the input field, allowing users to correct mistakes in input.

4. **Square Root (âˆš) Button**:
   - Pressing the 'âˆš' button calculates the square root of the current expression and displays the result.
   - *It handles potential errors such as taking the square root of a negative number and displays 'Error' in such cases*.

5. **Square (x^2) Button**:
   - The 'x^2' button calculates the square of the current expression and displays the result.
   - *It also handles potential errors and displays 'Error' if encountered*.

6. **Percentage (%) Button**:
   - The '%' button calculates the percentage of the current expression and displays the result.
   - *It handles potential errors and displays 'Error' if encountered*.

7. **Memory Functions**:
   - **Memory Store Button**: Stores the current value in memory.
   - **Memory Recall Button**: Recalls the value stored in memory and appends it to the current expression.
   - **Memory Clear Button**: Clears the value stored in memory.

8. **Color Change**:
   - The background color of the window changes randomly every few seconds for visual appeal.

### Additional Features
- The calculator GUI has a responsive design, allowing it to adapt to different screen sizes.
- Copyright notice is displayed at the bottom of the window.
